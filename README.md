# BOB-Hackathon-Audit-Compliance
Manual methods are prone to errors and inefficiencies. By leveraging generative AI, we aim to revolutionize audit and compliance, making these processes faster and more reliable, ensuring organizations stay compliant with evolving regulations.

This requires us to use RAG and Fine-Tuning Frameworks along with ensuring Data Privacy.

We inspire our UI for the application from Astra security UI on compliance analysis.

We plan to use the Azure RAG architecture for our idea.

## Azure Tools to be used
1. Azure AI for language processing and anomaly detection
2. Azure OpenAI: For LLM prompting and generating responses
3. Azure Machine Learning for model training and deployment
4. Azure Functions for serverless execution of audit processes

These resources will help us build a robust, scalable solution capable of handling complex audit tasks efficiently.
