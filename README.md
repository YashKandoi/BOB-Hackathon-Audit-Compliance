2. Generate **comprehensive compliance audit reports** with minimal human intervention by mapping them to these latest RBI Guidelines.
3. Checks for **several compliances(AML, KYC**) distributed over **different account types** (Savings, Current, Salary, Fixed Deposit, Recurring Deposit, NRI) and flags them if any **suspicious activity** has been detected.
4. Displays several insights about the different bank accounts and the savings made through the tool.
5. Top-notch **Privacy and Data Security** is maintained by creating different vector stores for each user's bank account and is only visible to the bank in the Azure Portal. This can also be deleted post-generation of audit reports.
