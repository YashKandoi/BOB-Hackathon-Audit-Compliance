In order to prevent banks and other financial institutions from being used as a channel for Money Laundering (ML)/ Terrorist Financing (TF) and to ensure the integrity and stability of the financial system, efforts are continuously being made both internationally and nationally, by way of prescribing various rules and regulations. Internationally, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) which is an inter-governmental body established in 1989 by the Ministers of its member jurisdictions, sets standards and promotes effective implementation of legal, regulatory and operational measures for combating money laundering, terrorist financing and other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system. India, being a member of FATF, is committed to upholding measures to protect the integrity of international financial system.

In India, the Prevention of Money-Laundering Act, 2002 and the Prevention of Money-Laundering (Maintenance of Records) Rules, 2005, form the legal framework on Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Countering Financing of Terrorism (CFT). In terms of the provisions of the PML Act, 2002 and the PML Rules, 2005, as amended from time to time by the Government of India, Regulated Entities (REs) are required to follow certain customer identification procedures while undertaking a transaction either by establishing an account-based relationship or otherwise and monitor their transactions.

2\. Accordingly, in exercise of the powers conferred by Sections 35A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the Banking Regulation Act (AACS), 1949, read with Section 56 of the Act ibid, Sections 45JA, 45K and 45L of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, Section 10 (2) read with Section 18 of Payment and Settlement Systems Act 2007 (Act 51 of 2007), Section 11(1) of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999, Rule 9(14) of Prevention of Money-Laundering (Maintenance of Records) Rules, 2005 and all other laws enabling the Reserve Bank in this regard, the Reserve Bank of India being satisfied that it is necessary and expedient in the public interest to do so, hereby issues the Directions hereinafter specified.

CHAPTER – IV  
Risk Management

12\. For Risk Management, REs shall have a risk-based approach which includes the following.

1.  Customers shall be categorised as low, medium and high-risk category, based on the assessment and risk perception of the RE.

iv) Any prompting observed at end of customer shall lead to rejection of the account opening process.

v) The fact of the V-CIP customer being an existing or new customer, or if it relates to a case rejected earlier or if the name appearing in some negative list should be factored in at appropriate stage of work-flow.

vi) The authorised official of the RE performing the V-CIP shall record audio-video as well as capture photograph of the customer present for identification and obtain the identification information using any one of the following:

1.  OTP based Aadhaar e-KYC authentication
